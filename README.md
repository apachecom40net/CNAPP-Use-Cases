# CNAPP-Use-Cases

Use Case | Description | Target People Inside Organization | Target Questions to Ask per Role | Potential Objections per Role | Key Answer to Objection
Cloud Misconfiguration Detection | Continuously scans cloud resources for misconfigurations that could lead to breaches. | - CISO  - Cloud Security Architect  - Cloud Operations Team | - How do we currently detect misconfigurations in our cloud environments?- Do we have real-time visibility into configuration drifts?- Are there compliance benchmarks (e.g., CIS, PCI) we need to enforce? | - We already have cloud-native tools (like AWS Config, Azure Policy).- Adding another tool could increase noise. | FortiCNAPP complements native tools by providing unified, cross-cloud visibility and prioritization, reducing alert fatigue.
Vulnerability Management | Identifies and prioritizes vulnerabilities in cloud workloads (VMs, containers, serverless). | - Security Operations Manager  - DevSecOps Engineer  - Application Security Team | - How are vulnerabilities in cloud workloads discovered and prioritized?- Is vulnerability scanning integrated into CI/CD pipelines?- How quickly can we fix critical vulnerabilities? | - Vulnerability scanning slows down CI/CD pipelines.- We already use other scanners (e.g., Tenable, Qualys). | FortiCNAPP offers agentless, API-based scanning with minimal impact on pipelines and can integrate findings into your existing tools.
Compliance Monitoring | Automates compliance checks and generates reports for standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR. | - Compliance Officer  - Internal Auditor  - Risk and Governance Team | - How do we validate cloud resources for compliance on an ongoing basis?- Are audit reports automated?- What areas cause us the most pain during audits? | - Compliance monitoring is already handled manually.- Regulatory audits happen only once a year; why automate? | Automating compliance reduces audit preparation time, minimizes human error, and ensures continuous readiness, not just point-in-time audits.
Identity and Access Risk Analysis | Detects excessive permissions and risky identity behaviors to enforce least privilege. | - IAM Manager  - Cloud Administrator  - Security Architect | - How do we manage over-permissioned identities in the cloud?- How often are IAM permissions reviewed?- Have we had any identity-related security issues? | - It's too complex to manage permissions across multi-cloud.- Changing permissions could break existing applications. | FortiCNAPP maps and visualizes identity risks across clouds and provides remediation recommendations with minimal business disruption.
Container and Kubernetes Security | Scans container images and running clusters for vulnerabilities and policy violations. | - DevOps Lead  - Cloud Platform Engineer  - SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) | - How are container images scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment?- Is security integrated early in development?- Are risky deployments automatically blocked? | - Developers resist adding more security checks.- Container scanning adds delay to deployment cycles. | FortiCNAPP embeds security into the CI/CD process seamlessly, prioritizing critical issues without slowing down developers.
Threat Detection and Response | Monitors cloud activity for suspicious behavior and enables automated threat response. | - SOC Analyst  - Security Engineer  - Incident Response Team | - How do we detect and respond to cloud-specific threats today?- Are threat detection events integrated with our SOC workflows?- Do we use automated responses for cloud incidents? | - Cloud threats are too different from traditional threats; false positives.- We already have a SIEM for detection. | FortiCNAPP applies cloud-specific threat models, reducing false positives, and enriches your SIEM/SOC with actionable cloud insights.
