# FortiCNAPP Use Cases - Extended Table

| **Use Case** | **Description** | **Target People Inside Organization** | **Target Questions to Ask per Role** | **Potential Objections per Role** | **Key Answers to Objections** |
|--------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Cloud Misconfiguration Detection** | Continuously scans cloud resources for misconfigurations that could lead to breaches. | - CISO <br> - Cloud Security Architect <br> - Cloud Operations Team | - How do we currently detect misconfigurations in our cloud environments?<br>- Do we have real-time visibility into configuration drifts?<br>- Are there compliance benchmarks (e.g., CIS, PCI) we need to enforce? | - We already have cloud-native tools (like AWS Config, Azure Policy).<br>- Adding another tool could increase noise. | - FortiCNAPP aggregates findings across clouds, adds risk prioritization, and reduces alert fatigue.<br>- It complements cloud-native tools by offering unified, cross-cloud visibility and deeper analytics. |
| **Vulnerability Management** | Identifies and prioritizes vulnerabilities in cloud workloads (VMs, containers, serverless). | - Security Operations Manager <br> - DevSecOps Engineer <br> - Application Security Team | - How are vulnerabilities in cloud workloads discovered and prioritized?<br>- Is vulnerability scanning integrated into CI/CD pipelines?<br>- How quickly can we fix critical vulnerabilities? | - Vulnerability scanning slows down CI/CD pipelines.<br>- We already use other scanners (e.g., Tenable, Qualys). | - FortiCNAPP can integrate seamlessly into CI/CD to scan early without delaying pipelines.<br>- It offers cloud-specific risk context that complements traditional scanners. |
| **Compliance Monitoring** | Automates compliance checks and generates reports for standards like PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR. | - Compliance Officer <br> - Internal Auditor <br> - Risk and Governance Team | - How do we validate cloud resources for compliance on an ongoing basis?<br>- Are audit reports automated?<br>- What areas cause us the most pain during audits? | - Compliance monitoring is already handled manually.<br>- Regulatory audits happen only once a year; why automate? | - Continuous compliance reduces risk exposure between audits.<br>- FortiCNAPP automates evidence collection, reducing manual effort and audit preparation time significantly. |
| **Identity and Access Risk Analysis** | Detects excessive permissions and risky identity behaviors to enforce least privilege. | - IAM Manager <br> - Cloud Administrator <br> - Security Architect | - How do we manage over-permissioned identities in the cloud?<br>- How often are IAM permissions reviewed?<br>- Have we had any identity-related security issues? | - It's too complex to manage permissions across multi-cloud.<br>- Changing permissions could break existing applications. | - FortiCNAPP helps visualize permission risks across cloud accounts and identities.<br>- Recommendations are risk-based and can be staged to avoid disruptions. |
| **Container and Kubernetes Security** | Scans container images and running clusters for vulnerabilities and policy violations. | - DevOps Lead <br> - Cloud Platform Engineer <br> - SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) | - How are container images scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment?<br>- Is security integrated early in development?<br>- Are risky deployments automatically blocked? | - Developers resist adding more security checks.<br>- Container scanning adds delay to deployment cycles. | - FortiCNAPP integrates early (shift-left) and minimizes performance impact with lightweight scanning.<br>- Security policies can be enforced without slowing innovation. |
| **Threat Detection and Response** | Monitors cloud activity for suspicious behavior and enables automated threat response. | - SOC Analyst <br> - Security Engineer <br> - Incident Response Team | - How do we detect and respond to cloud-specific threats today?<br>- Are threat detection events integrated with our SOC workflows?<br>- Do we use automated responses for cloud incidents? | - Cloud threats are too different from traditional threats; false positives.<br>- We already have a SIEM for detection. | - FortiCNAPP enriches detection with cloud-native context, reducing false positives.<br>- It integrates easily with SIEM/SOAR platforms to streamline incident response. |
